  <p>Change of html-tag sends a mail </p>

  <h2>Project</h3>
    <p>I wanted to buy something for myself from a site, but it has no "notify me when back in stock"-button, so I made a webscraping-script that will send me (or anyone else)
  a mail when back in stock. This is made by checking if the value of a html-tag of a given product is "QTY" > 0.
